  "In my last full semester before I graduate with a BSc in Computer Science with a Physics minor. I currently live with my fiancé and our 1-year-old daughter. Recently finished 16 months of co-op, half of which I spent as a full stack developer at Clio (Cloud-Based Legal Technology) in Vancouver. Returning to full-time work in January 2022, hoping to focus on growing security-focused software skills.";

  "I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in 2019. I haven't always shared that information openly, but my time at Clio made me feel comfortable and confident with bringing my whole self to work. I'm open to talk about my experiences and would love to engage with neurodiversity programs at other tech companies to help others that might be feel alone or lost in this neurotypical world!";
