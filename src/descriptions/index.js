      "I engaged with my team in project planning, constructive code reviews, and in-depth discussion on topics like threat modelling, scaling, and user experience. My responsibilities ranged from hosting meetings, connecting with stakeholders, writing technical and team documents, and communicating project goals. I had the oppurtunity to collaborate with other teams to solve various problems and gain a rich understanding of the tech-stack.",

After two months, my daughter was born, and I had to adjust to a new lifestyle and keep progressing in my work. I spent the majority of my time building or patching UI components for the site's shared library.",
      "In my final few months, I took on the larger project of creating an API that sent customer feedback from a UI on the site, straight into Salesforce. This meant integrating with other APIs (i.e. Vault by Hashicorp and Salesforce). Hardening the API to prevent any data loss or malicious strings was the most interesting and instructive part of this.",

The system's test suite used Selenium with a centralized class to perform automated regression testing, but this was difficult to maintain because of the number of different pages and sub-pages that needed to tested. I worked on refactoring the test suite to leverage a more object-oriented approach where each page had its own Java-Selenium class that could be inherited by subpages.",
