          In 2016 I came to UVic to start a Physics degeree. Computer Science
          was required, but I had no idea what it was. Over the next few years I
          quickly transition from a CSC minor, to a combined-major, to now a CSC
          Major and Physics minor. My first co-op (while still Physics major)
          was a programming job, and I realized the interest-to-difficulty ratio
          in CSC worked much better for me!

        <Typography style={{ padding: "8px" }}>
          Physics worked great for playing to the strengths of how my brain
          worked, very mathimatecally-focus and patter-driven. When things
          started to go quantum I realized CSC might be a better fit. In my
          final semester I am focused on security and application-vs-theory
          courses, ranging from network protocols to data science.
